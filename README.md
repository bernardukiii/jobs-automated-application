## Getting Started with job-search-simplifier

<ol>
<li>Clone repo with <code>git clone git@github.com:bernardukiii/jobs-automated-application.git</code></li>
<li>Run <code>pip install</code></li>
<li>Run <code>python /src/app.py</code> in your terminal</li>
<li>Navigate the app using <code>Enter</code> and the keywords <code>done</code> & <code>y</code> or <code>n</code></li>
</ol>

<h3>*Additional notes</h3>
<p>This is not 100% reliable when automating forms. It will work with some forms and even then with some input fields. <br></br>
It would have to be extended with hundreds or thousands of options when it comes to finding the elements such as input fields given that not all pages have the same HTML/UI/STYLING structure.
<br></br>
So I am clarifying with this statement that this was to solve a bothersome task and to practice my Python skills more than to create a perfect all round solution.
